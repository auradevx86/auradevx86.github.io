    <h1 class="center">Win32 API tutorial</h1>
    <h2 class="center">part 0: introduction</h2>

    <p>so, here we are. at this point, you should have confirmed that you want to learn how to use the Win32 API.</p>

    <h2>recommended IDEs</h2>
    <p>if you are confused on what IDE to use, here are the ones I recommend:
        <h3><b>Visual Studio Community</b></h3>
        this is a contraversial one, honestly it's not the best IDE for small scale projects, but I'm using it because of the MSVC++ compiler. 
            <br>(in fact, i usually just use VSCode and just run it from Visual Studio code tools)
            <br>this is a good choice for first time Win32 developers as it does set up a lot of the stuff for you, so you can rest assured that your compiler options will work.
            <b>takeaways: automatic setup, good debugging tools, but the tools are very complex and not very flexible.</b>
        <h3><b>Visual Studio Code (VSCode)</b></h3>
        this is a common one. very similar to visual studio, but you have to set up a lot of the stuff you want to use. 
        <br>less debugging tools, but so much more user-customisable. a lot less lightweight too!
        <h3><b>Code::Blocks</b></h3>
        also very lightweight, and it does set up a lot of things for you.
        <br>however, it is a lot less flexible at Visual Studio Code, and also doesn't support MSVC++ (Microsoft's C++ compiler)
        <h3><b>Notepad/Notepad++</b></h3>
        i've grouped these two together because notepad++ is slightly more optimised for coding. 
        <br>they're both fine to use, but NO debugging tools at all so get used to the command line tools.
        <h3><b>vim or nano</b></h3>
        these are both command line editors and they're both good, but like notepad and notepad++, no debugging tools so have fun specifying every compiler option! 
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2>testing to see if your compiler works</h2>
    <p>
        to make Windows programs, you need to make sure your tools are working!
        <br>to see if your compiler can compile this, copy and paste this code here and see if it compiles:
        <div class="code">
            <p>
                #include <<Windows.h>><br>
                <br>
                int WINAPI wWinMain(HINSTANCE hInstance, HINSTANCE hPrevInstance, PWSTR pCmdLine, int nCmdShow) {<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;return 0;<br>
                }
            </p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>didn't work? let's find out why!</p>
        <h3>troubleshooting</h3>
        if you've gotten to this point this code probably doesn't work.
        <br>try these steps to get your code to work.
        <br>
        <h3><br><b>Error LNK<i>xxxx</i> - undefined reference to WinMain@16 (or something like that)</b></h3>
        <br>if this happens, it means that it is trying to compile as a console application, and a Win32 GUI application is NOT a console application.
        <br>so if this happens, try these steps:<br>    
        <br><b>using MSVC++ (Visual Studio):</b>
        <br>right click your project, click properties.
        <br>once on the properties page, on the left hand side, click Linker > SubSystem.
        <br>change the value to Windows (SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS) and click Apply or OK.
        <br>and now tryto see if it compiles.
        <br><br>
        
    </p>
