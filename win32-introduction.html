    <h1 class="center">Win32 API tutorial</h1>
    <h2 class="center">part -1: introduction</h2>

    <p>hi! if you're here, i'm assuming that</p>
    <ul>
        <li>you want to know how to learn how to program native Windows programs</li>
        <li>you are/want to use/using windows</li>
        <li>you want to use C++</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>so what the hell is the Win32 API even?</h3>
    <p>the Win32 API is the API that Windows uses to create Windows-specific programs.
        this is the lowest level of Windows programming that you use.
        program APIs like Java Swing, wxWidgets and .NET Forms all have calls to the Win32 API!
        it's just that they handle most of the nitty gritty bits for you, just like higher level programming languages
        such as Python will have calls to low-level assembly. this is the code that Windows uses directly. this will
        be what the processor will tell Windows to do. (well, not exactly, because assembly and stuff)
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>if it's so low level, why should i use it?</h2>
    <p>
        <h3><b><i>warning: lots of tl;dr here, if you don't want to read this, that's fine.</i></b></h3><br>
        we have stuff like wxWidgets, Qt, GTK+, why use the lowest level?
        <br>
        usually we use the Win32 API for compatibility, flexibility and preference.
        <br>
        lots of the Win32 API have remanents from 16-bit Windows! (i love 16 bit)<br>
        but you'll realise that most Win32 applications will run much better than Qt and GTK+.
        <br>
        but it does give a great deal of flexibility. you can easily decide whether you want compatibility for older versions of Windows,<br>
        or whether you want the status bar to use this, blah blah blah. <br>
        for example, i cannot stress how much i hate using .NET Forms status bar control,
        for the time i usually spend on trying to get correct a .NET Forms status bar correct I could have created it in the Win32 API, mow the lawn,
        and hoard 10 kilos of HRT pills.

        which comes to our final argument, just preference. i've come to realise i don't like using wrapper classes because they usually
        do all the work for you, and i've always being intrigued about low level stuff. it's the same reason why some people use assembly instead of Python.
    </p>

    <h2>the scope of this tutorial</h2>
    <p>the Win32 API is vast. don't believe me? just go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\ and you'll see everything. that's the Win32 API.</p>
    <p>it includes driver interactions, console tools, low level drawing, etc but we're going to focus on the GUI part of everything, because that's what Windows is all about, literal windows.</p>
    <p>microsoft has documented the other functions on the low level stuff pretty well, so i don't think i need to go through this.</p>

    <h2>why did i even create this?</h2>
    <p>there are so many tutorials on the Win32 API. why did I create my own?</p>
    <p>trust me, i'm not a professional programmer, i'm a trans girl who instead of playing games in class like the cool kids i spend my class time programming and doodling.<br>
        but i've realised that a big API like the Win32 API means there are so many variations of how to write programs correctly, and all the info that i've gathered 
        is very scattered all over the place. <br>i've got bits and bobs from this place, and some others from another. 
        <br>
        additionally, a Win32 program is very delicate.<br> it needs specific compiler options in order to work, which vary from compiler to compiler.
        and these throw errors that are so arcane that it can be very overwhelming.<br> the variations between compilers and different code styles are 
        so different between each other, it's hard to know what will and won't compile using your options and compiler.
        <br>i've tried to put in as many variations i could find, and if you have questions, you can hit me up on social media.
        <h3><b><i>END OF TL;DR</i></b></h3>
    </p>

    <h2>prexiquites</h2>
    <p>unfortunately, i have not created a normal C++ tutorial yet, so this tutorial will NOT cover any basic C++ stuff.</p>
    <p>the things you need to know how to use are: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>variables</li>
        <li>headers</li>
        <li>strings</li>
        <li>pointers</li>
        <li>basic language features (such as if, switch, delete)</li>
        <li>preprocessor definitions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>i'm sorry if i offend if i say this, but this is usually very basic C++ knowledge. if you don't know any C++ or these things, i would recommend you turn back or continue if you like, 
        you either have complete free will or something or someone is dictating you to do one of these options.</p>
    <p>i don't expect you to know how to use any specific IDEs i mention, or any compiler options.</p>
    <p>so, basically i just expect you to know how to write a basic C++ program (or C, most of these tutorials will work on C as well, and will be stated otherwise)</p>

    <h2>alrightly, let's start learning how to make your first program in the Win32 API! </h2>
